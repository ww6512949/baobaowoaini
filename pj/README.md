## Abstract

This project is our team project for CS4400 in Spring semester, 2016 at Georgia Tech. Our goal is to Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an application for buying train tickets at GTTrain.com. Basically this project involves the usage of classical methodology for database development. The system is using a relational DBMS(MySQL) that supports standard SQL queries.

## What Does It Include?

This repository includes all the file that are required for the finals. And this project is a three phase project. Each phase has different tasks which are described as follow.

0. Project Description v1.0.pdf: This is our project assignment, you can find out the specific requirement in it.

1. EER.png & IFD.png: These two files are the main task for phase I.

2. Relational Schema.pdf & Create table statement.pdf: These two files are the main task for phase II.

3. Train Ticket System.py & SQL task statements: These two files are the main task for phase III(heavy option). If you prefer light option, then you just need to submit the SQL statement, however, you must take the final exam too.

4. localhost.sql: This is the database that we create which is compatible to MySQL 5.1.

## How to Run?

The techniques we use in this project are the Tkinter GUI library built-in Python3.5 and SQL language. We set up the database based on the relational schema and make up some data to test it. The database is setup in our school's server. If you want to run this code, just make sure you are using Python3 and the PIL and PyMySQL packages are installed. Then you can just download it and run it directly.
